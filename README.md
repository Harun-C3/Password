Simple Password Generator in C++

This project is a basic password generator written in C++ that creates secure, random passwords based on user input. The program asks the user to specify the desired length of the password and then generates a random sequence of characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, ensuring strong password security.

The code leverages C++ libraries for randomness and allows customization of password length, making it versatile for different security needs. This project demonstrates fundamental programming skills such as user input handling, random number generation, and working with character arrays.
